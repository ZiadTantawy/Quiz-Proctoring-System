# Quiz Proctoring System
The project is about creating a Prolog program to manage the assignment of teaching assistants (TAs) to proctor quizzes based on their schedules. The program needs to ensure that no TA is assigned to proctor during their teaching slots or on their day off, and it should also prevent assigning a TA to multiple quizzes during the same time slot.

There are four main tasks the program needs to handle:

Assigning proctors to quizzes while meeting the constraints.
Identifying when TAs are free by analyzing their schedules and day-offs.
Assigning TAs to quizzes based on their availability, ensuring they are not overbooked or assigned during teaching hours.
Verifying a specific assignment of TAs to a quiz to check if it meets the given constraints.
The final output should be a valid schedule where all quizzes are proctored by the required number of available TAs.
